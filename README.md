# Tank Game
*Disclaimer: This was originally coded in a dedicated Java IDE so I'm having some trouble getting the code to run through Github. Currently I cannot get it to run in Github*

I made this game during my second year at college as my A Level Computer Science Coursework. I programmed the game using Java, and the Java Swing toolkit for the GUI, because I was interested in what it would be like to make a game from scratch instead of using an IDE that already has functionality built in for game development, such as in built collision checkers. In the game, you play as a tank either by yourself or with another player using the same keyboard. In the 2 player mode, the aim is to shoot the other player first whilst avoiding getting shot by using cover from walls. I also added several powerups that randomly spawn in to give players different boosts, such as shooting through walls for a limited time. In the 1 player mode the aim is to navigate the map and shoot all ten targets as quickly as possible, then your time is given to you at the end.

Since, I'm having touble getting the file to run, I have instead uploaded a video file showing how the game works.
